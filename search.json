two unknowns, and consider the following system of equations.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\beta_1 + 3 \\beta_2 ={}& 4 \\\\\n\\beta_1 + 3 \\beta_2 ={}& 5 \\\\\n\\beta_1 + 2 \\beta_2 ={}& 7 \\\\\n\\beta_1

\\\\ \\beta_2\\end{pmatrix}\\) is the \\(2\\)–vector of unknowns, \\(\\X\\) is a \\(5 \\times 2\\) matrix, and \\(\\Y\\) is a \\(5\\)–vector.\n(b) How many solutions does this sytem of equations have? Briefly justify your answer.\nSolutions\n(a)\n\\[\n\\X = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 3 \\\\\n1 & 3 \\\\\n1 & 2 \\\\\n1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 9 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\quad\n\\Y =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n4 \\\\\n5 \\\\\n7 \\\\\n1 \\\\\n9 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\quad\n\\]\n(b)\nThere are no solutions. For example, the first two equations are incompatible with one another.\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\nFor this problem, I will use the following definitions.\n\n\\(\\X\\) denotes an \\(N \\times P\\) matrix\n\\(\\Y\\) denotes an \\(N\\)–vector (i.e. an \\(N \\times 1\\) matrix)\n\\(\\betav\\) denotes a \\(P\\)–vector\n\nTake \\(N &gt; P &gt; 1\\). You may assume that \\(\\X\\) is full column rank.\nFor each expression, write the dimension of the result, or write “badly formed” if the expression is not a valid matrix expression.\n\n\\(\\X^\\trans \\X\\)\n\\(\\X \\beta\\)\n\\(\\Y^\\trans \\Y\\)\n\\(\\Y \\Y^\\trans\\)\n\\(\\trace{\\Y \\Y^\\trans}\\)\n\\(\\Y - \\X \\beta\\)\n\\((\\X^\\trans \\X)^{-1}\\)\n\\(\\X^\\trans \\left( \\Y - \\X \\beta \\right)\\)\n\\(\\X^\\trans \\Y - \\X^\\trans \\X \\beta\\)\n\\((\\X^\\trans \\X)^{-1} \\X^\\trans \\Y - \\beta\\)\n\nSolutions\n\n\\(\\X^\\trans \\X: P \\times P\\)\n\\(\\X \\beta: N \\times 1\\)\n\\(\\Y^\\trans \\Y: 1 \\times 1\\)\n\\(\\Y \\Y^\\trans: N \\times N\\)\n\\(\\trace{\\Y \\Y^\\trans}: 1 \\times 1\\)\n\\(\\Y - \\X \\beta: N \\times 1\\)\n\\((\\X^\\trans \\X)^{-1}: P \\times P\\)\n\\(\\X^\\trans \\left( \\Y - \\X \\beta \\right): P \\times 1\\)\n\\(\\X^\\trans \\Y - \\X^\\trans \\X \\beta: P \\times 1\\)\n\\((\\X^\\trans \\X)^{-1} \\X^\\trans \\Y - \\beta: P \\times 1\\)\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3\nSuppose I have a dataset in which each row is a student, and the columns contain the following variables for a given year:\n\nTheir final score in a linear models class\nThe self-reported total number of hours spent studying per week\nTheir grade in a prerequesite theoretical statistics course (like STAT135)\nWhether or not they are a foreign exchange student\n\nConsider two ways I might consider using this dataset:\n(Use 1) How much can a student expect to increase their linear models grade by spending more hours studying?\n(Use 2) How can I identify students who may need extra assistance at the beginning of the next semseter of linear models?\n(a) Which of these two uses is a prediction problem, and which is an inference problem?\n(b) Which question do you expect to be easier to answer with this dataset?\nBriefly justify your answers.\nSolutions\n(a) Use 1 is an inference problem, and use 2 is a prediction problem. Use 1 is a causal inference problem estimating the effect of changing study habits on grades; for example, if the students who study more are already good at math, then a positive association between studying and good grades may be spurious. In contrast, if we only want to identify students who might struggle (Use 2) then all we need to know is the association between a variable and the outcome rather than any causual effect.\n(b) Use 2 would be easier to answer, since we can answer it even in the presence of unobserved confounding variables.\n\nExtra space for answers (indicate clearly which problem you are working on)\n\nExtra space for answers (indicate clearly which problem you are working on)"

Aakash, JohnPatrick Connors, Michael D. Shields, Variability in the thermo-mechanical behavior of structural aluminum, Thin-Walled Structures, Volume 144, 2019, 106122, ISSN 0263-8231. (link)\nPaper abstract: The nominal performance of structural aluminum alloys at elevated temperature has been thoroughly investigated in the past. Although it is well known that the performance of a given material specimen will differ from the nominal behavior, the extent of this variability has not been quantitied to date. This limits the ability to perform reliability and performance-based design and analysis for aluminum structures subjected to high temperatures (e.g. in structural fire engineering). This work presents an experimental investigation of the variability in the stress-strain behavior of AA 6061-T651 (as a model ductile aluminum alloy). We performed steady-state tensile tests on nine different batches of nominally identical material sourced from different suppliers/manufacturers at six different temperatures (20 °C, 100 °C, 150 °C, 200 °C, 250 °C, and 300 °C) under two different geometries to induce uniaxial tension and plane strain stress states in the gauge section. The results are investigated statistically to illustrate variability in the salient features of the stress-strain behavior of the material ranging from nonlinear elastic behavior to strain localization and ductile fracture. Some observations on material performance and its variability are made along the way. Overall, it is illustrated that variations between batches of material can be quite large and – especially as it relates to strain localization, necking, and material failure – variations can be very large even within a fixed batch of material. To encourage data of this nature to be expanded and integrated into research and practice to improve structural design and investigations, the full searchable dataset are publicly available with experimental details published concurrently through Data in Brief.\n\nLink to csv\nSource link (downloaded Dec 2023)",

Similarly, we can see immediately that the expression \\(\\underset{NP}{\\boldsymbol{X}} \\underset{NP}{\\boldsymbol{X}}\\) is invalid because \\(P\\) is next to \\(N\\) in the matrix multiplication, which is not allowed.\n\n\\(\\boldsymbol{X}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{y}\\)\n\\(\\boldsymbol{X}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{X}\\)\n\\(\\boldsymbol{X}+ \\boldsymbol{y}\\)\n\\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^\\intercal\\)\n\\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\)\n\\(\\boldsymbol{y}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{y}\\)\n\\(\\boldsymbol{X}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{y}\\) (Duplicate — that’s okay, just repeat the other answer)\n\\(\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{X}\\right)^\\intercal\\)\n\\(\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{y}\\right)^\\intercal\\)\n\\(\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{X}\\right)^{-1}\\)\n\\(\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{y}\\right)^{-1}\\)\n\\(\\boldsymbol{X}^{-1}\\)\n\\(\\boldsymbol{y}^{-1} \\boldsymbol{y}\\)\n\\((\\boldsymbol{X}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{X})^{-1} \\boldsymbol{X}^\\intercal\\)\n\\((\\boldsymbol{X}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{X})^{-1} \\boldsymbol{X}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{y}\\)\n\\(\\left( (\\boldsymbol{X}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{X})^{-1} \\boldsymbol{X}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{y}\\right)^\\intercal\\)\n\\(\\boldsymbol{y}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{X}(\\boldsymbol{X}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{X})^{-1}\\)\n\\(\\boldsymbol{X}\\beta\\)\n\\(\\boldsymbol{y}- \\boldsymbol{X}\\beta\\)\n\\(\\boldsymbol{y}- \\boldsymbol{X}^\\intercal\\beta\\)\n\\(\\boldsymbol{y}^\\intercal- \\beta^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{X}^\\intercal\\)\n\\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}- (\\boldsymbol{X}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{X})^{-1}  \\boldsymbol{X}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{y}\\)\n\\(\\boldsymbol{X}\\left( \\boldsymbol{\\beta}- (\\boldsymbol{X}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{X})^{-1}  \\boldsymbol{X}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{y}\\right)\\)\n\\(\\boldsymbol{1}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{y}\\)\n\\(\\boldsymbol{y}- (\\boldsymbol{1}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{y}) \\boldsymbol{y}\\)\n\\(\\boldsymbol{X}(\\boldsymbol{X}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{X})^{-1} \\boldsymbol{X}^\\intercal\\)\n\\(\\boldsymbol{X}^\\intercal(\\boldsymbol{X}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{X})^{-1} \\boldsymbol{X}\\)\n\\(\\boldsymbol{X}^\\intercal(\\boldsymbol{X}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{X})^{-1} \\boldsymbol{X}\\) (Duplicate — that’s okay, just repeat the other answer)\n\\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^\\intercal(\\boldsymbol{X}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{X})^{-1}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\)\n\\(\\left( \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^\\intercal(\\boldsymbol{X}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{X})^{-1}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\right)^{-1}\\)\n\\(\\mathrm{trace}\\left( \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^\\intercal(\\boldsymbol{X}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{X})^{-1}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\right)\\)\n\\(\\mathrm{trace}\\left( (\\boldsymbol{X}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{X})^{-1}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^\\intercal\\right)\\)\n\n\n\n3 Orthonormal vectors and bases\nFor this problem, assume that \\(\\boldsymbol{u}= (u_1, u_2)^\\intercal\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{v}= (v_1, v_2)^\\intercal\\) are orthonormal. That is, \\(\\boldsymbol{u}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{u}= \\boldsymbol{v}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{v}= 1\\), and \\(\\boldsymbol{u}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{v}= 0\\). Let \\(\\boldsymbol{a}= (a_1, a_2)^\\intercal\\) denote a generic \\(2\\)–dimensional vector.\n\nWrite an expression for the length of \\(\\boldsymbol{a}\\) in terms of its entries \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_2\\).\nWrite an expression for the length of \\(\\boldsymbol{a}\\), using only matrix operations (i.e., without explicit reference to the entries of \\(\\boldsymbol{a}\\)).\nWrite an explicit expression for a vector pointing in the same direction as \\(\\boldsymbol{a}\\) but with unit length. (Hint: show that, for a scalar \\(\\alpha\\), the length of \\(\\alpha \\boldsymbol{a}\\) is \\(\\alpha\\) times the length of \\(\\boldsymbol{a}\\), and then make a clever choice for \\(\\alpha\\).)\nWrite an explicit expression for a vector pointing in the same direction as \\(\\boldsymbol{v}\\) but with the same length as \\(\\boldsymbol{a}\\).\nSuppose that I tell you that \\(\\boldsymbol{a}= \\alpha \\boldsymbol{u}+ \\gamma \\boldsymbol{v}\\). Find an explicit expression for \\(\\alpha\\) in terms of \\(\\boldsymbol{a}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{u}\\) alone.\nFind explicit expressions for scalars \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\gamma\\) such that \\(\\boldsymbol{a}= \\alpha \\boldsymbol{u}+ \\gamma \\boldsymbol{v}\\).\nLet \\(\\begin{pmatrix} \\boldsymbol{u}& \\boldsymbol{v}\\end{pmatrix} := \\begin{pmatrix}\nu_1 & v_1 \\\\ u_2 & v_2\\end{pmatrix}\\) denote the \\(2 \\times 2\\) matrix with \\(\\boldsymbol{u}\\) in the first column and \\(\\boldsymbol{v}\\) in the second column. Show that \\(\\begin{pmatrix} \\boldsymbol{u}& \\boldsymbol{v}\\end{pmatrix}^\\intercal= \\begin{pmatrix} \\boldsymbol{u}& \\boldsymbol{v}\\end{pmatrix}^{-1}\\).\nObserve that \\(\\alpha \\boldsymbol{u}+ \\gamma \\boldsymbol{v}=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\boldsymbol{u}&\n\\boldsymbol{v}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\alpha \\\\\n\\gamma\n\\end{pmatrix}.\\) Using this, write an explicit expression for the coefficient vector \\((\\alpha, \\gamma)^\\intercal\\) in terms of \\(\\begin{pmatrix} \\boldsymbol{u}& \\boldsymbol{v}\\end{pmatrix}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{a}\\).\nShow that \\(\\begin{pmatrix} \\boldsymbol{u}& \\boldsymbol{v}\\end{pmatrix}^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\boldsymbol{u}& \\boldsymbol{v}\\end{pmatrix}^\\intercal\\).\nSuppose I tell you that that \\(\\boldsymbol{u}= (1, 0)^\\intercal\\). In terms of \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_2\\), what is \\(\\alpha\\) in the decomposition \\(\\boldsymbol{a}= \\alpha \\boldsymbol{u}+ \\gamma \\boldsymbol{v}\\)?\n\n\n\n4 Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of square symmetric matrices\nLet \\(\\boldsymbol{A}\\) denote a \\(P \\times P\\) symmetric, square matrix. Recall that an “eigenvalue” \\(\\lambda_k\\) of and its associated “eigenvector” \\(\\boldsymbol{u}_k\\) of \\(\\boldsymbol{A}\\) satisfy \\(\\boldsymbol{A}\\boldsymbol{u}_k = \\lambda_k \\boldsymbol{u}_k\\). (In this definition, \\(\\boldsymbol{u}_k\\) must be non–degenerate, i.e., it must have some nonzero entries.)\nLet \\(\\boldsymbol{U}= (\\boldsymbol{u}_1 \\ldots \\boldsymbol{u}_P)\\) denote the \\(P \\times P\\) matrix with eigenvector \\(\\boldsymbol{u}_k\\) in the \\(k\\)–th column, and let \\(\\Lambda\\) denote the \\(P \\times P\\) diagonal matrix with \\(\\lambda_k\\) in the \\(k\\)–th diagonal entry. Let \\(\\boldsymbol{a}\\) denote a generic \\(P\\)–vector.\n\nIf \\(\\boldsymbol{A}\\) is the identity matrix (i.e., the matrix with ones on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere), what are its eigenvalues?\n\n\nIf \\(\\boldsymbol{A}\\) is the zero matrix (i.e., the matrix containing only zeros), what are its eigenvalues?\n\n\nIf \\(\\boldsymbol{A}\\) is a diagonal matrix with the entries \\(a_1, \\ldots, a_P\\) on the diagonal, what are its eigenvalues?\n\n\nLet us prove that the eigenvectors can be taken to be unit vectors without loss of generality.\n\nShow that, if \\(\\boldsymbol{u}_k\\) is an eigenvector, then \\(\\alpha \\boldsymbol{u}_k\\) is also an eigenvector with the same eigenvalue as \\(\\boldsymbol{u}_k\\) for any scalar \\(\\alpha \\ne 0\\).\nIn particular, show that \\(\\boldsymbol{u}_k' = \\boldsymbol{u}_k / \\sqrt{\\boldsymbol{u}_k^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{u}_k}\\) is also an eigenvector with eigenvalue \\(\\lambda_k\\), and that \\((\\boldsymbol{u}_k')^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{u}'_k = 1\\).\n\n\n\nLet us prove that, for a general symmetric matrix, eigenvectors with distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal. That is, if \\(\\lambda_k \\ne \\lambda_j\\) for some \\(k \\ne j\\), we will show that \\(\\boldsymbol{u}_k^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{u}_j = 0\\). Carefully justify each step in the following proof.\n\nWe have \\(\\boldsymbol{u}_j^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{A}\\boldsymbol{u}_k = (\\boldsymbol{u}_j^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{A}\\boldsymbol{u}_k)^\\intercal\\). (Why?)\nWe also have \\((\\boldsymbol{u}_j^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{A}\\boldsymbol{u}_k)^\\intercal= \\boldsymbol{u}_k^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{A}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{u}_j\\). (Why?)\nWe then have \\(\\boldsymbol{u}_j^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{A}\\boldsymbol{u}_k = \\boldsymbol{u}_k^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{A}\\boldsymbol{u}_j\\). (Why?)\nWe then have \\(\\lambda_k \\boldsymbol{u}_j^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{u}_k = \\lambda_j \\boldsymbol{u}_k^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{u}_j\\). (Why?)\nWe then have \\(\\boldsymbol{u}_k^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{u}_j = 0\\). (Why?)\nNote (not graded): If the eigenvalues are not distinct, then the corresponding eigenvectors may not be orthogonal. However, one can always find an orthogonal set of eigenvectors for each repeated eigenvalue, though we won’t prove this here. See a linear algebra text for the proof, or try yourself! Hint: if \\(\\lambda_k = \\lambda_j\\) for some \\(k \\ne j\\), then \\(\\alpha \\boldsymbol{u}_k + \\gamma \\boldsymbol{u}_j\\) is also an eigenvector with eigenvalue \\(\\lambda_k\\) for any \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\gamma\\).\n\n\n\nSuppose that each \\(\\lambda_k \\ne 0\\). Show that the inverse of \\(\\Lambda\\) is given by the diagonal matrix with \\(1  / \\lambda_k\\) in the \\(k\\)–th diagonal entry and zero elsewhere.\n\n\nSuppose that \\(\\lambda_k = 0\\) for some \\(k\\). Show that \\(\\Lambda\\) is not invertible. Hint: find a vector \\(\\boldsymbol{b}\\) such that \\(\\Lambda \\boldsymbol{a}= \\boldsymbol{b}\\) has no solution. From this it would follow that \\(\\Lambda\\) is not invertible by contradiction for, if \\(\\Lambda\\) were invertible, \\(\\boldsymbol{a}= \\Lambda^{-1} \\boldsymbol{b}\\) would be a solution.\n\n\nAssume that \\(\\boldsymbol{A}\\) has \\(P\\) orthonormal eigenvectors (it always does; we have proved some parts of this assertion above). We will prove that we then have \\(\\boldsymbol{A}= \\boldsymbol{U}\\Lambda \\boldsymbol{U}^\\intercal\\). Carefully justify each step in the following proof.\n\nFor any \\(\\boldsymbol{a}\\), we can write \\(\\boldsymbol{a}= \\sum_{p=1}^P \\alpha_p \\boldsymbol{u}_p\\) for some scalars \\(\\alpha_p\\). (Why?)\nUsing the previous expansion, we thus have \\(\\boldsymbol{A}\\boldsymbol{a}= \\sum_{p=1}^P \\lambda_p \\alpha_p \\boldsymbol{u}_p\\). (Why?)\nLet \\(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}= (\\alpha_1, \\ldots, \\alpha_P)^\\intercal\\). Then \\(\\boldsymbol{a}= \\boldsymbol{U}\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\). (Why?)\nSimilarly, we have \\(\\boldsymbol{A}\\boldsymbol{a}= \\boldsymbol{U}\\Lambda \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\). (Why?)\nWe also have \\(\\boldsymbol{u}_p^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{a}= \\alpha_p\\). (Why?)\nWe then have \\(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}= \\boldsymbol{U}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{a}\\). (Why?)\nCombining, we have \\(\\boldsymbol{A}\\boldsymbol{a}= \\boldsymbol{U}\\Lambda \\boldsymbol{U}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{a}\\). (Why?)\nSince the preceding expression is true for any \\(\\boldsymbol{a}\\), we must have \\(\\boldsymbol{A}= \\boldsymbol{U}\\Lambda \\boldsymbol{U}^\\intercal\\). (Why? Hint: if you take \\(\\boldsymbol{a}\\) to be \\(1\\) in the first entry and zeros elsewhere, then we have that the first columns match. Continue in this fashion to show that each entry of the matrices are the same.)\n\n\n\n\n5 Statistical asymptotics\nFor this problem, suppose that \\(x_n\\) are independent and identically distributed random variables, with \\(\\mathbb{E}\\left[x_n\\right] = 3\\), and \\(\\mathrm{Var}\\left(x_n\\right) = 4\\). You should not assume that the \\(x_n\\) are normally distributed.\nRecall that \\(\\mathrm{Var}\\left(x_n\\right) = \\mathbb{E}\\left[x_n^2\\right] - \\mathbb{E}\\left[x_n\\right]^2\\). Also recall that, for any scalar \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\alpha x_n\\right] = \\alpha \\mathbb{E}\\left[x_n\\right]\\), and \\(\\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\alpha x_n\\right) = \\mathbb{E}\\left[(\\alpha x_n)^2\\right] - \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\alpha x_n\\right]^2 = \\alpha^2 \\mathrm{Var}\\left(x_n\\right)\\).\nFor each limiting statement, state clearly whether your answer is a constant, a random variable, or that the limit does not exist. If the limit is a random variable, give its distribution. If it is a constant, give its value. If it does not exist, argue why. You may refer to known results from probability theory, particularly the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem.\n\nFor any particular (finite) value of \\(N\\), is \\(\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^Nx_n\\) a constant or a random variable?\nFor any particular (finite) value of \\(N\\), is \\(\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^N\\mathbb{E}\\left[x_n\\right]\\) a constant or a random variable?\nCompute the expectation \\(\\mathbb{E}\\left[x_1 + x_2\\right]\\).\nCompute the expectation \\(\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{2} (x_1 + x_2)\\right]\\).\nCompute the expectation \\(\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{3} (x_1 + x_2 + x_3)\\right]\\).\nCompute the expectation \\(\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^Nx_n\\right]\\).\nCompute the variance \\(\\mathrm{Var}\\left(x_1 + x_2\\right)\\).\nCompute the variance \\(\\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{2} (x_1 + x_2)\\right)\\).\nCompute the variance \\(\\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{3} (x_1 + x_2 + x_3)\\right)\\).\nCompute the variance \\(\\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^Nx_n\\right)\\).\nAs \\(N \\rightarrow \\infty\\), what (if anything) does \\(\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^Nx_n\\) converge to?\nAs \\(N \\rightarrow \\infty\\), what (if anything) does \\(\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^N(x_n - 3)\\) converge to?\nAs \\(N \\rightarrow \\infty\\), what (if anything) does \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\sum_{n=1}^N(x_n - 3)\\) converge to?\nAs \\(N \\rightarrow \\infty\\), what (if anything) does \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\sum_{n=1}^Nx_n\\) converge to?\nAs \\(N \\rightarrow \\infty\\), what (if anything) does \\(\\sum_{n=1}^Nx_n\\) converge to?\nAs \\(N \\rightarrow \\infty\\), what (if anything) does \\(\\sum_{n=1}^N(x_n - 3)\\) converge to?\n(Bonus question — will not be graded) What is the limit as \\(N \\rightarrow \\infty\\) of \\(\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^N(4 \\cdot (-1)^n + 3)\\)? In contrast, suppose that \\(x_n\\) is generated by randomly flipping a coin and setting \\(x_n = 3 + 4\\) if the coin comes up heads and \\(x_n = 3 - 4\\) if it comes up tails. What is different about the convergence of \\(\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^N(4 \\cdot (-1)^n + 3)\\) and the convergence of \\(\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^Nx_n\\)?\n\n\n\n6 Bad coding\nSuppose you work at Spotify, and a colleague told you that high energy songs are the most popular.

That is, let\n\\[\n\\boldsymbol{x}_n = \\begin{cases}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0\n\\end{pmatrix} & \\textrm{ when }z_n = a \\\\\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0\n\\end{pmatrix} & \\textrm{ when }z_n = b \\\\\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1\n\\end{pmatrix} & \\textrm{ when }z_n = c \\\\\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nLet \\(\\boldsymbol{X}\\) be the regressor matrix with \\(\\boldsymbol{x}_n^\\intercal\\) in row \\(n\\).\n\n(a)\nLet \\(N_a\\) be the number of observations with \\(z_n\\) = a, and let \\(\\sum_{n:z_n = a}\\) denote a sum over rows with \\(z_n\\) = a, with analogous definitions for b and c. In terms of these quantities, write expressions for \\(\\boldsymbol{X}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{X}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{X}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{Y}\\).\n\n\n(b)\nWhen is \\(\\boldsymbol{X}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{X}\\) invertible? Explain intuitively why the regression problem cannot be solved when \\(\\boldsymbol{X}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{X}\\) is not invertible. Write an explicit expression for \\((\\boldsymbol{X}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{X})^{-1}\\) when it is invertible.\n\n\n(c)\nUsing your previous answer, show that the least squares vector \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\\) is the mean of \\(y_n\\) within distinct values of \\(z_n\\).\n\n\n(e)\nSuppose now you include a constant in the regression, so that\n\\[\ny_n = \\alpha + \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{x}_n + \\varepsilon_n,\n\\]\nand let \\(\\boldsymbol{X}'\\) denote the regressor matrix for this regression with coefficient vector \\((\\alpha, \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^\\intercal)^\\intercal\\). Write an expression for \\(\\boldsymbol{X}'^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{X}'\\) and show that it is not invertible.\n\n\n(f)\nFind three distinct values of \\((\\alpha, \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^\\intercal)\\) that all give the exact same fit \\(\\alpha + \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{x}_n\\).\n\n\n\n4 Correlated regressors\nSuppose that \\(y_n = \\boldsymbol{x}_n^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{\\beta}+ \\varepsilon_n\\) for some \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\). Suppose that \\(\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\varepsilon_n\\right] = 0\\) and \\(\\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\varepsilon_n\\right) = \\sigma^2\\), and \\(\\varepsilon_n\\) are independent of each other and the \\(\\boldsymbol{x}_n\\).\nLet \\(\\boldsymbol{x}_n \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}\\), where\n\n\\(\\boldsymbol{x}_n\\) is independent of \\(\\boldsymbol{x}_m\\) for \\(n \\ne m\\),\n\\(\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\boldsymbol{x}_{n1}\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\boldsymbol{x}_{n2}\\right] = 0\\),\n\\(\\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{n1}\\right) = \\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{n2}\\right) = 1\\), and\n\\(\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\boldsymbol{x}_{n1} \\boldsymbol{x}_{n2}\\right] = \\rho\\).\n\n\n(a)\nIf \\(\\left|\\rho\\right| &lt; 1\\), is \\(\\boldsymbol{X}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{X}\\) always, sometimes, or never invertible?\n\n\n(b)\nIf \\(\\left|\\rho\\right| = 1\\), is \\(\\boldsymbol{X}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{X}\\) always, sometimes, or never invertible?\n\n\n(c)\nWhat is \\(\\lim_{N \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{1}{N} \\boldsymbol{X}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{X}\\)? When is the limit invertible?\n\n\n(d)\nState intuitively why there is no unique \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\\) when \\(\\rho = 1\\). When \\(\\rho = 1\\), give two distinct values of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) that result in the same fit \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{x}_n\\).\n\n\n\n5 Matrix square roots\nIn the last homework, we proved that if \\(\\boldsymbol{A}\\) is a square symmetric matrix with eigenvalues \\(\\boldsymbol{u}_p\\) and eigenvectors \\(\\lambda_p\\), then we can write \\(\\boldsymbol{A}= \\boldsymbol{U}\\Lambda \\boldsymbol{U}^\\intercal\\), where \\(\\boldsymbol{U}= (\\boldsymbol{u}_1 \\ldots \\boldsymbol{u}_p)\\) has \\(\\boldsymbol{u}_p\\) in its \\(p\\)–th column, and \\(\\Lambda\\) is diagonal with \\(\\lambda_p\\) in the \\(p\\)–th diagonal entry. We also have that the eigenvectors can be taken to be orthonormal without loss of generality.\nWe will additionally assume that \\(\\boldsymbol{A}= \\boldsymbol{X}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{X}\\) for some (possibly non–square) matrix \\(\\boldsymbol{X}\\).\nDefine \\(\\Lambda^{1/2}\\) to be the diagonal matrix with \\(\\sqrt{\\lambda_p}\\) on the \\(p\\)–th diagonal.\n\nProve that, since \\(\\boldsymbol{A}= \\boldsymbol{X}^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{X}\\), \\(\\lambda_p \\ge 0\\), and so \\(\\Lambda^{1/2}\\) is always real–valued.\nWhen the eignevalues are non–negative, we say that \\(\\boldsymbol{A}\\) is “positive semi–definite.” (Hint: using the fact that \\(\\lambda_p = \\boldsymbol{u}_p^\\intercal\\boldsymbol{A}\\boldsymbol{u}_p\\), show that \\(\\lambda_p\\) is the square of something.)\nShow that if we take \\(\\boldsymbol{Q}= \\boldsymbol{U}\\Lambda^{1/2} \\boldsymbol{U}^\\intercal\\) then \\(\\boldsymbol{A}= \\boldsymbol{Q}\\boldsymbol{Q}^\\intercal\\). We say that \\(\\boldsymbol{Q}\\) is a “matrix square root” of \\(\\boldsymbol{A}\\).\nShow that we also have \\(\\boldsymbol{A}= \\boldsymbol{Q}\\boldsymbol{Q}\\) (without the second transpose).\nShow that, if \\(\\boldsymbol{V}\\) is any orthonormal matrix (a matrix with orthonormal columns), then \\(\\boldsymbol{Q}' = \\boldsymbol{Q}\\boldsymbol{V}\\ne \\boldsymbol{Q}\\) also satisfies \\(\\boldsymbol{A}= \\boldsymbol{Q}' \\boldsymbol{Q}'^\\intercal\\). This shows that the matrix square root is not unique. (This fact can be thought of as the matrix analogue of the fact that \\(4 = 2 \\cdot 2\\) but also \\(4 = (-2) \\cdot (-2)\\)).\nShow that if \\(\\lambda_p &gt; 0\\) then \\(\\boldsymbol{Q}\\) is invertible.\nShow that, if \\(\\boldsymbol{Q}\\) is invertible, then the columns of \\(\\boldsymbol{X}\\boldsymbol{Q}^{-1}\\) are orthonormal. (Hint: show that \\((\\boldsymbol{X}\\boldsymbol{Q}^{-1})^\\intercal(\\boldsymbol{X}\\boldsymbol{Q}^{-1})\\) is the identity matrix.)"

    "text": "Objectives\nBy the end of the course, you should be able to\n\nExpress standard regression analyses both mathematically and in R code\nCritically relate the intended use of a regression analysis to its methods and assumptions\nIdentify common practical and conceptual pitfalls of regression analysis, and to improve the analysis when possible\nCommunicate the process and results of a regression analysis simply and clearly for a broad audience, using well-organized prose, reproducible code, and effective data visualizations.\n\n\n\nAssignments, Exams, and Grading\n\nAttendance\nAttendance in lectures will be required and will contribute to the participation portion of the students’ grade. Laptops will not be permitted in lectures, and violation of this policy can constitute an absence for the purpose of the participation grade.\nIpads and phones will be permitted during lecture for note-taking as long as their use doesn’t inhibit participation.\nEach student will be given four lecture absences without losing any participation points, with the expectation that these absences will be used for illness and emergencies. Additional excused absences will be granted only with an exception granted by the Berkeley DSP office.\nAttendance at labs will be optional.\n\n\nGrading.\nThe weighting for the grades will be:\n\nHomework completion (each weighted equally): 25%\nHomework correctness (each weighted equally): 5%\nQuizzes (each weighted equally): 30%\nFinal exam: 15%\nFinal group project: 15%\nParticipation (primarily lecture attendance): 10%\n\nGrades will not be curved except where otherwise noted. Letter grades will be assigned according the weighted points earned. A score within [90-92%) will earn an A-, [92-98%) will earn an A, and [99-100%) will earn an A+. Scores in the 80’s will receive B’s, in the 70’s will receive C’s, in the 60’s will receive D’s, with the same thresholds for plusses and minuses. Scores below 60% will be considered failing. Grades will be non-negotiable.\n\n\nFinal exam.\nAn in-person pencil-and-paper final exam will be scheduled during the usual final exam week. Students will be allowed a one-page double-sided “cheatsheet” on the final exam.\n\n\nQuizzes.\nEvery two weeks we will have an thirty-minute in-class quiz, typically on the Tuesday following a homework due date. These quizzes will take the place of a sitdown midterm exam (i.e., there will be no midterm). No external materials, including cheatsheets, will be allowed during quizzes.\n\n\nHomework.\nHomework assignments will be due every two weeks on Fridays two weeks later at 9pm. I will try to release new homework on the website as soon as possible after the old one is due, typically the following Monday evening. Homework will typically consist of a combination of mathematical problems and data analysis in R. All homework will be due as a pdf via Gradescope unless otherwise noted. Students can use whatever tool they like to produce the pdf (latex, Rmd, Jupyter, scanned handwritten notes for mathematical problems, etc.).\nThe purpose of homework is for students to attempt to work through problems on their own, both to advance their own understanding, and to allow the instructors to monitor student learning. Neither of these objectives are served if students are copying answers. For that reason, thoughtful and complete homework answers will receive nearly full credit (80% of the available homework points) even if incorrect. We strongly encourage students to submit their own best efforts, even if imperfect, rather than copy a correct answer.\n\n\nFinal group project.\nStudents will form groups of up to three people to submit a final project consisting of an analysis of a real dataset applying principles and techniques from the course.\n\n\nTurning in assignments\nYou will be turning in your assignments on a platform called\nGradescope. This is also the platform where your assignments will be graded, so you can return there to get feedback on your work. You are welcome to file a regrade request if you notice that we made an error in applying the rubric to your work, but be sure to do so within a week of the grades being posted. We will not accept regrade requests past that point.\nIn order to provide flexibility around emergencies that might arise for you throughout the semester (for example, missing a quiz due to COVID), we will apply for everyone:\n\none emergency drop for quizzes\n\ntwo emergency drops for homework (applying to an entire two–week assignment)\n\nThis means that we will drop your lowest quiz score (which would be a 0 if you were absent) before computing your quiz average. For homework, we will drop your two lowest. Unless students are excused by official university policies, additional drops will not be given.\nWe strongly recommend that students reserve their emergency drops for real emergencies.\n\n\nLate Work\nLate work will not be accepted. If work is not submitted on time, it will receive a zero. It is entirely the students’ responsibility to turn work in on time. If there is any uncertainty concerning this policy, please discuss your concerns with the professor, not with the GSI or reader.\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nThis course will assume familiarity with the material in STAT 135 or STAT 102. STAT 135 implies other prerequisite courses (STAT 134 and its prerequisites). In particular, you must have had linear algebra, so you should be familiar with basic matrix operations, vector subspaces and projections, rank and invertibility of matrices, and quadratic forms.\nThis semester of Stat151A will include labs and projects in the R language. Proficiency with R at the level of the is a prerequisite. Students with a strong background in another programming language (e.g. Python) will be permitted to enroll with the understanding that they will learn R on their own prior to the start of the class.\n\nRStudio\nThe software that we’ll be using for our data analysis is the free and open-source language called R that we’ll be interacting with via software called RStudio. If you have difficulty installing RStudio, please reach out to an instructor.\n\n\nCourse website\nAll of the assignments will be posted to the course website at https://stat151a.berkeley.edu/fall-2024/. This also holds the course notes, the syllabus, and links to Gradescope and RStudio.\n\n\n\nPolicies\n\nCourse Culture\nStudents taking STAT151A come from a wide range of backgrounds. We hope to foster an inclusive and supportive learning environment based on curiosity rather than competition. All members of the course community—the instructor, students, tutors, and readers—are expected to treat each other with courtesy and respect.\nYou will be interacting with course staff and fellow students in several different environments: in class, over the discussion forum, and in office hours. Some of these will be in person, some of them will be online, but the same expectations hold: be kind, be respectful, be professional.\nIf you are concerned about classroom environment issues created by other students or course staff, please come talk to the instructors about it.\n\n\nCollaboration policy\nYou are encouraged to collaborate with your fellow students on problem sets and labs, but the work you turn in should reflect your own understanding and all of your collaborators must be cited. The individual component of quizzes, reading questions, and exams must reflect only your work.\nResearchers don’t use one another’s research without permission; scholars and students always use proper citations in papers; professors may not circulate or publish student papers without the writer’s permission; and students may not circulate or post non-public materials (quizzes, exams, rubrics-any private class materials) from their class without the written permission of the instructor.\nThe general rule: you must not submit assignments that reflect the work of others unless they are a cited collaborator.\nThe following examples of collaboration are allowed and in fact encouraged!\n\nDiscussing how to solve a problem with a classmate.\nShowing your code to a classmate along with an error message or confusing output.\nPosting snippets of your code to the discussion forum when seeking help.\nHelping other students solve questions on the discussion with conceptual pointers or snippets of code that doesn’t whole hog give away the answer.\nGoogling the text of an error message.\nCopying small snippets of code from answers on Stack Overflow.\n\nThe following examples are not allowed:\n\nLeaving a representation of your assignment (the text, a screenshot) where students (current and future) can access it. Examples of this include websites like course hero, on a group text chain, over discord/slack, or in a file passed on to future students.\nAccessing and submitting solutions to assignments from other students distributed as above. This includes copying written answers from other students and slightly modifying the language to differentiate it.\nSearching or using generative AI to produce complete problem solutions.\nWorking on the final exam or individual quizzes in collaboration with other people or resources. These assignments must reflect individual work.\nSubmitting work on an exam that reflects consultation with outside resources or other people. Exams must reflect individual work.\n\nIf you have questions about the boundaries of the policy, please ask. We’re always happy to clarify.\n\n\nViolations of the collaboration policy\nThe integrity of our course depends on our ability to ensure that students do not violate the collaboration policy. We take this responsibility seriously and forward cases of academic misconduct to the Center for Student Conduct.\nStudents determined to have violated the academic misconduct policy by the Center for Student Conduct will receive a grade penalty in the course and a sanction from the university which is generally: (i) First violation: Non-Reportable Warning and educational intervention, (ii) Second violation: Suspension/Disciplinary Probation and educational interventions, (iii) Third violation: Dismissal.\nAgain, if you have questions about the boundaries of the collaboration policy, please ask!\n\n\nLaptop policy\nLaptops will not be permitted in lecture, but will be required for labs.\nIf you do not have access to a laptop, you can borrow one from the University library. See the UC Berkeley hardware lending program for more details. The Student Technology Equity Program is another good resource. Feel free to contact the instructor if you have concerns about your access to needed technology.\n\n\nCOVID policy\nMaintaining your health and that of the Berkeley community is of primary importance to course staff, so if you are feeling ill or have been exposed to illness, please do not come to class. All of the materials used in class will be posted to the course website. You’re encouraged to reach out to fellow students to discuss the class materials or stop by group tutoring or office hours to chat with a tutor or the instructor.\n\n\nAccomodations for students with disabilities\nStat 151A is a course that is designed to allow all students to succeed. If you have letters of accommodations from the Disabled Students’ Program, please share them with your instructor as soon as possible, and we will work out the necessary arrangements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThese course polices are based on a template and text generously shared by Andrew Bray. Thanks, Andrew!",

This setup is called a “regression problem,” and can be attacked with lots of models, including non-linear models.

I hope to make it a course about concepts in statistics in machine learning more generally, but viewed within the relatively simple framework of linear models. Some examples that one might touch on at least briefly include:\n\nAsymptotics under misspecification\nRegularization\nSparsity\nThe bias / variance tradeoff\nThe influence function\nDomain transfer\nDistributed learning\nConformal inference\nPermutation testing\nBayesian methods\nBenign overfitting\n\nI will probably not get to all of these, though you should feel free to ask about them in office hours.

But the content of this course doesn’t stop and math and conding, just as learning language alone does not give you something to say. Linear models will be a mathematical and computational tool for communicating with and about the real world. Datasets can speak to us in the language of linear models, and we can communicate with other humans through the language of linear models. Learning to communicate effectively in this way is the most important content of this course, and is a skill that will remain relevent whether or not you ever interpret or fit another linear model in your life.\nStatistical analyses are mathematical, and so are often formulated as beginning from “assumptions,” from which we derive statistical conclusions, from which we derive real world conclusions. For example, we might look at housing price data and:\n\nAssume that the housing prices are a linear function of square footage, with IID normally distributed errors,\nUsing the assumption construct a 95% confidence interval for the slope of the line and,\nInfer something about how much more a particular house would sell for if you build it larger.\n\nA statistics class will typically spend a lot of time on getting from (1) to (2). (For better or worse, the present course will not be a complete exception.) The problem is that the assumption (1) is flatly absurd, and that the leap from (2) to (3) is far more problematic than the leap from (1) to (2). On the other hand, it is probably not really the case that steps (1) and (2) tell you nothing at all about the relationship between square footage and housing costs, it’s just that they don’t constitute any watertight or formal style of inference. Probably a better word for (1) would be “conceit” rather than “assumption,” since you know it to be false, but are willing to entertain it tenatively in order to learn something from the data. Here we can come back to Wittgenstein’s generosity: “They say, after all, that it gives them some guidance”.\nWhether or not a statistical analysis is “good” cannot be evaluated outside a particular context. It is not a mathematical property, even though mathematical techniques can illuminate egregious errors. And it appears to be too strict to say that the assumptions (or conceits) are false and so the whole thing is nonsense, and yet it is clear that statistical analysis does not (typically) live up to any strong claim of logical rigor. So we have to ask contextual questions. Why do we care about the conclusions of this analysis? What will they be used for? Who needs to understand our analysis? What are the consequences of certain kinds of errors, including the application of implausible conceits?\nOutside of a classroom, you will probably never encounter a linear model without a real question and context attached to it. I will make a real effort in this class to respect this fact, and always present data in context, to the extent possible within a classroom setting. I hope you will in turn get in the habit of always thinking about the context of a problem, even when going through formal homework and lab exercises.\nFor pedagogical reasons we may have to step into abstract territory at times, but I will make an effort to tie what we learn back to reality, and, in grading we’ll make sure to reward your efforts to do so as well.
